# Obsidian Note Highlighter Plugin

Highlights the notes that contain 1 or more todos.

## How does it work?

Open any note and write `TODO` in **uppercase**. This will add an highlighter to that note. It doesn't matter how many `TODO`'s you have in a note or where in your notes you write them.

If you have no `TODO`'s anymore in a note, the highlighter will be removed.

## Make it your own

There are 2 settings you can edit:

-   Size: this will change the size of the highlighter. This can be max 25. Default size is 15.
-   Color: you can use the color picker to change the color of the highlighter. Default color is black.
